# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What are you planning to build?
  
  We aim to create a shortcuts mobile application that leads seniors to others applications they use frequently without any complications. Seniors often have issues learning and using new technology, so they need a product that simplifies this task. This is especially useful as over the past few months, social networking apps have become the primary mode of communication due to COVID-19. Although the younger population is comfortable with this change, it poses a problem for seniors. We hope that our application can simplify the steps it takes to navigate different apps including WhatsApp, Google, YouTube, Zoom, Email and Facebook. To do so, we plan to include short tutorial screens that cover basic functionality of frequently used applications. For example, we would create a short tutorial on how to create a post or upload pictures and videos to a Facebook timeline. These tasks seem simple for everyday users; however, for seniors, this is a difficult task as they are not familiar with the app’s common features. In addition, we plan to simplify the user interface for seniors by listing out the most frequently used apps on a single screen. This will make it easier for them to navigate to different applications, as they can simply tap the appropriate icon instead of finding the app on their phone. In all, we hope to create a product that matches everyday functionality with an intuitive and senior-friendly interface.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

  * Edith, aged 82, lives alone in Toronto. She misses her grandkids a lot but cannot visit them due to COVID-19. Her daughter often tells her to video call them using Zoom, but she finds the process too complicated and intimidating.
  * Reginald, aged 64, is applying for government benefits. He needs to check his email consistently for updates, but he keeps forgetting how to access his inbox and where to look for new emails.
  * Ruth, aged 75, is a very extroverted woman who wants to keep in contact with her friends from her walking club using Facebook; however, she cannot figure out how to add new friends.
  * Earl, aged 65, likes to watch cat videos on YouTube. But whenever he opens the app, he gets overwhelmed by all the advertisements and recommendations, and swiftly closes it. 

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

  The product will help users navigate the apps they use frequently. Today, they are using the default UI of their OS, reading/watching tutorials online, and attending workshops. Our app would save users time, as it would simplify this process by providing any instructions they need right in the app. Our target users are seniors who are not familiar with their phone applications but want to use social networking apps to stay connected with their friends and family, or for entertainment. Although other shortcut apps exist that allow users to contact people quickly during an emergency, our app would exist for recreational purposes. Before COVID-19, seniors were able to seek help from other individuals they encountered; however, due to social distancing, they are left to figure out the steps of navigating apps on their own, which is a daunting task for them. Our app’s aim is to provide basic instructions on the main features for each app listed in question 1. 
  
  Our partner’s organization, Toronto Family Services holds workshops and group events to help people in the community resolve issues they face on a regular basis; this includes helping seniors adjust to the “new normal” of COVID-19. However, the seminars that were once held in person have all become virtual, making it challenging for seniors to join Zoom workshops and participate in them. Our app aims to provide simple tutorials so that they can join online workshops with ease and get any other guidance they need regarding using different apps in the product itself. We hope that by explicitly defining the steps needed to navigate each app, our target users will find the process less intimidating. 


#### Q4: How will you build it?
  
  * Languages
    * Kotlin, Java (Android Studio)
    * Objective-C (for iOS)

  * APIs
    * YouTube

  * Testing
    * Espresso (UI testing)
    * JUnit (Unit testing)

  We don’t plan on using databases (for now) because our partner requires the app to be as simple as possible as not to confuse the users. Our partner representative stressed that it should be a single page application that opens directly to app shortcuts. Thus, we are storing user information locally to avoid adding complicated features such as log-in pages. To test the functionality and determine if the application is in fact user friendly, we plan to ask seniors in our own household to use the application as they are similar to our target users. We also plan to give our partner representative regular updates and get his feedback so we can continuously make improvements to the application.


#### Q5: What are the user stories that make up the MVP?

  * As a senior coordinator of Senior Community Connections, I want to have an app that can easily redirect the user to other apps in order to help the seniors tackle their limitations to access new technology.
  * As a senior user, I want to navigate to the Zoom app without having to click any small buttons so that I can call my son.
  * As a senior who has never used a mobile device before, I want to edit my profile on Facebook as I do on a desktop easily using this app.
  * As a senior, I want to navigate to Youtube using this app in order to watch cooking tutorials to master my cooking skills.
  * As a senior I need to access my email regularly, but memorizing various buttons, usernames, and passwords is too hard. I want to use this app to easily access my email.
  * As a senior user, I want to know how to search for and connect with my friends on Facebook so I can stay connected with them.
  * As a senior user who is not logged into Facebook/Zoom/Email/Whatsapp, I want to see all the steps needed in order to sign in
  * As a senior user, I want to see a tutorial on how to send and receive pictures and videos on WhatsApp so that I can communicate with my friends and family

#### Q7: What operational events will you have as a team?

  Zoom meetings with our partner are scheduled every Thursday at 2pm. During each meeting, we will report our progress and get feedback from our project partner. We also have recurring online group meetings on Saturdays at 12 pm to discuss our progress and any setbacks/conflicts we faced and our goals for the following week. 

  **Meeting Minutes** : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gINzjWZ5vGLBx6dlsOZsIKdZl6e_YZfcARguXcmvTj0/edit?usp=sharing 

  During our first meeting with our partner, we discussed their expectations for the product. The partner coordinator described areas of difficulty for seniors in accessing different apps as well as the features they hoped could be implemented. At the end, we decided to research the API’s of different apps and how they can be incorporated into our app. 

  In the second meeting, we presented our concerns regarding the feasibility of the product; a lot of the expectations of our coordinator could not have been met in the given timeline. Instead, we proposed a different structure for the application where users would get a tutorial of how to use the application before being redirected to it. At the end, we had a strong vision of how the app would be implemented.

  
#### Q8: What artifacts will you use to self-organize?

  * **Google Docs:** Used to record meeting minutes, shared with the whole group and updated weekly
  * **Github Issues:** Used to keep track of tasks to be completed; assigning and prioritizing tasks is the responsibility of the Task Managers, with input from the rest of the group
  * **FaceBook Messenger Group:** Primary place of communication, where we discuss ideas and resolve any conflicts
  * **Email:** Communicating with our project partner for setting up meetings, sharing data about app features.
  * **Zoom:** Primary method of video communication with our project partner for weekly meetings


#### Q9: What are the rules regarding how your team works?

  * **Communications:**
    * Weekly messenger audio calls to keep track of team progress
    * Check messenger group chat at least twice a day for any updates; post any immediate issues, concerns or updates
    * Recurring weekly zoom meetings scheduled with partner where we ask for feedback and provide project updates
    * 2 Project Liaisons who are responsible for voicing any concerns to the project coordinator in between meetings

  * **Meetings:**
    * Excel spreadsheet to keep track of attendance during weekly partner and group meetings
    * Task Managers ensure tasks assigned on Github Issues are being completed in a timely manner
    * Moderator ensures all concerns are discussed during meetings and everyone’s ideas are heard during meetings
    * Scribe keeps track of everything discussed during meetings
    * If we notice someone is not consistently attending meetings or completing tasks, we will assign them a smaller role in the future

  * **Conflict Resolution:**
    * Scenario 1: A team member is not contributing enough before a deadline.
      * Resolution: We would first contact the team member directly using Facebook Messenger and discuss any difficulties they may be facing with completing their assigned tasks to clear up any confusions or misunderstandings. If the team member is unable to contribute due to personal problems or circumstances outside of their control, we would redistribute the work as necessary. However, if that is not the case and the behaviour persists, we would contact the TA to inform them of this conflict.
    * Scenario 2: The team is unable to make a decision about the product.
      * Resolution: We would present the pros and cons of each choice to the group and leave it up to a vote. If a vote fails to decide the outcome, then we would let the person responsible for coding the aspect make an executive decision. 
    * Scenario 3: A team member does not respond to messages in the group chat and does not attend a group and/or partner meeting.
      * Resolution: We would contact the team member directly as described in scenario 1 and make sure they are alright. If they cannot attend due to valid private reasons, then we would update them with any important information they missed. However, if they were absent consistently with no reasonable explanations, we would contact the TA to discuss further action.

### Highlights

  We chose the applications we would add shortcuts for from a survey presented by the partner coordinator based on the applications used most frequently by seniors in their organization. From there, we researched if the applications’ UI could be simplified to be more user-friendly. We found that for example with Facebook, we would have to first apply for a developer license and wait for approval before accessing their app features; a fully functioning application would also need to be approved before being deployed. Since the timeline to create our product is rather short, we decided to create an app which displays detailed tutorials of the main features of a frequently used app before redirecting the user to said app. This way, we would not need external permission to modify any existing app’s features or layout and it would work well given the timeline.

  When choosing our tech stack, we first considered which languages each team member was most comfortable with; Python and Java were the mutual consensus. We chose against using React Native to construct our app as the learning curve was too steep and not everyone was comfortable using JavaScript. Our initial plan is to use a combination of Java and Kotlin in Android Studio as well as Objective-C to construct the Android and iOS versions of our app respectively. Tasks were assigned based on the strengths and weaknesses of each team member.
