## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

  * When: Thursday, November 19, 2020 - 2:00 pm
  * Where: Online Zoom Meeting
 
## Process - Reflection

#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well
  * Everyone was assigned to a fairly equal portion of the front-end work (as that was the biggest segment of our application) and any changes or improvement needed for any individual’s part was communicated to them so that they had full control of it, and we were easily able to avoid many merge conflicts.
  * We had weekly team meetings along with weekly partner meetings to keep one another and our partner updated on our progress and/or difficulties. This was very effective as we were able to help one another with any issues we may have faced and were all able to understand the developmental process better.
  * Using Google Docs to record meeting minutes was very helpful as it was accessible and editable by the entire group. Anyone who was unable to attend the partner meetings in any given week could review the changes in the document and stay updated:

  * We were able to use Facebook Messenger as a very effective tool of communication beyond our weekly meetings. It was a very efficient way to bring up any pressing issues, concerns, or queries throughout the day, especially for teammates working in different timezones who may have difficulty attending meetings or calls. The chat was also consistently very responsive so everyone always had someone to aid them should they require it.
 
#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
  * We did not use Github Issues as frequently as we had hoped. Initially, we chose to assign the Task Manager role to 2 group members so they could create and supervise Github Issues consistently to ensure tasks were being updated and completed on time. However, we chose to only create an Android app (instead of both Android and iOS) during the course of deliverable 2. As a result, the tasks were split evenly amongst group members, as each person was responsible for creating tutorials for their specific app, and we didn’t need to assign additional tasks via Github Issues.

  * Perhaps partner meetings should have been rescheduled so that all team members could have regularly attended. We decided to keep the current schedule since it was difficult to get a time that worked as well for most group members and to avoid inconveniencing our partner contact with varying schedules.
  * We didn’t end up using excel spreadsheets to keep track of meeting attendance, as our group members were responsible and punctual, and we didn’t have any conflicts regarding absent or unresponsive members. Although it would have been an effective reminder of who needs to be reminded of the most recent updates, the Facebook chat generally served this purpose in its place.
 
#### Q3. Planned changes
  * When creating any additional features for our application after Deliverable 2, we hope to use Github Issues to assign tasks to improve code cleanliness and communication. At this point, the tutorials for each application are completed and fully functional, so role divisions working forward may be a little unclear; thus, using Github Issues would clear up any confusions.
  * Scheduling more meetings earlier on in the Deliverable 3 and 4 process would be beneficial as we had some confusion as a group before we started some of the functionalities in Deliverable 2. These confusions were cleared up with our weekly meetings later on so it would be effective to also have longer and more frequent meetings towards the start of implementing a new functionality or process.

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

We prepared our demo through Android Studio’s emulator as our partner contact did not have an android device to run it on his own. We were able to show a completely functioning version of our application. It achieved all of the functionalities mentioned in the Readme.
 
Our partner seemed appreciative of the work we had done and the product we presented him. As we demonstrated all the functionalities of the application, he reiterated the positive influence it will have on seniors and novice technology users. He made the suggestion of including applications’ names along with their respective logos on the homepage so they are easily identifiable. We discussed next steps and additional functionalities we can incorporate such as translations in multiple languages. We also decided upon an open source licensing model so that others may be able to add other tutorials and applications further down the line.
 
Our demo went quite smoothly. We did, however, learn to have the emulator prepared ahead of time as it took a minute to load during our demo which we could avoid moving forward. Similarly, we also learned to have our questions for our partner organized and prepared prior to the demo as we were recalling things spontaneously over the course of the call which could have been handled more logistically.
